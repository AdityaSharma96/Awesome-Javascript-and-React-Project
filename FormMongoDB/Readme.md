# FormMongoDB

The project stores the data collected from an HTML form into a Mongo Database.

The dependencies involved to run the project are Express.js, Mongoose

To run the program.
Simply clone the directory

Then in your project folder run
```
npm install
```
#the command installs all your dependencies

Then configure your mongodb, make sure it is running in the background

Then execute the following command in your project folder's CMD

```
node app.js
```

That's all. 



Thanks
